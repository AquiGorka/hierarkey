Chapter 2: SMS
--------------

Have you ever been to Jam'all?

Nope, I've never had the guts to go in there, they'll probably send me back to level 0 if I'm not high enough.

No, no, they don't do that anymore, you know it is illegal..

Yeah, well, that hasn't stopped it from happening, all the government officials rank so high up they don't really care..

That's not true, most of them just show off as if they were high rollers, but I'm sure they can't even go beyond beginner levels..

Lol, that's lame

So, are you coming? We'll meet there at later..ish, and don't worry, they won't send you back to newbie.. They use the website to tell which level you're currently ranked and that way they don't screw you..

Sure, I'll be there. Cheers
