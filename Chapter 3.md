# Chapter 3: Loophole

So I've been giving this a lot of thought and I think I finally get it: the payouts come form the total amount of players singing up divided by twelve - I believe it is a yearly thing, anyways, as I was saying, only one person can cash out on any given level, that means they'll never run out of dough and that it basically stays alive from new people signing up.

What about the people that pay to rank higher?

That's just a myth, have you ever seen one of those one-time links?

Not really, I have seen one that was no longer active though..

That's it, I think it is just the type of thing they want you to believe, that you can outclass the rest. And, people are mean to each other constantly "dropping" them all the time..

..wait, how can there be any higher ranking people if those links are not valid, there has to be a way, doesn't it?

Yeah, my theory is that they give out higher ranking codes only to people familiar with the system, see, if the systems works, THEY win. It is so thanks to all thesuckers out there who think they'll eventually rise to a cash-earning level..

..all levels earn cash..

..to tell you the truth, one millionth of a cent isn't really money that pays the bills.

What are you saying?

This whole thing is just a typical ponzy scheme and I have figured out how to beat it.
