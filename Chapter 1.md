# Chapter 1: Tutorial

"You can learn a lot from a person if you learn their HierarKey level."

"What?"

"You mean to tell me you've never heard of HierarKey?"

"It is a simple thing, yet it spawn a global phenomena that spread in so many directions. It is a way to tell who is the better person between two individuals. We haven't been able to crack it, hell, maybe that is one of the reasons why it stuck. You see, you need to go into this website and sign up, there's a sign up fee and you don't even have to give them your name since everything you need will be kept in your mobile. When you sign they show you a QR code, which you need to scan with their app. Once you've scanned it you're in, you have the opportunity to make money withdrawals.."

"They pay you to.."

"..no, no, according to your level you are entitled to make a monthly withdrawal, the catch is that only one withdrawal per level is allowed. So basically the first person on your level to make the withdrawal earns the cash."

"How much can you take?"

"At first, near to nothing, but this is the fun part, the higher the HierarKey level, higher the available amount to withdraw."

"..and how does one..."

".. there are two ways: first way is to pay for it, but - and it is a fun but - no one knows how much each level goes for and it changes constantly. You have to win a one time activation link where you are given the opportunity to pay to earn a higher level and you choose how much to pay, and then they will grant you access to a level according to how much you did pay. But the thing is, let's say, you paid ten dollars on one occation and you rose up N levels, another time you are not guaranteed to rise the same N levels even if you pay the same amount.."

"Why would you want to pay more than once?"

".. that's where the second way to rise the HierarKey ladder comes in. You see, a higher level person can choose to either up you to their level or remove your current level from you - it can only be one of this two choices everytime HierarKey people meet."

"Yeah, so, how does that work, then?"

"It's easy, if you're with someone and you both wish to learn each other's level you both have to bring out your apps and scan each other's QR Code and the system will automatically tell who is the higher ranked, and take the next steps into turning the lower ranked one up to the other person's level or removing him from the game, in which case, he'll have to sign up again."

"Hahaha, and do people actually do this?"

"ALL THE TIME, haven't you heard of bars where you can only enter if you are properly ranked? or events only for the high HierarKey society? or HierarKey discounts?"

"Yeah, but I never figured until now, that's how they go about.."

"..oh wait, there's more, so much more. People started treating this as a game, and as such it went viral so fast that everyone except you is playing.."

"and what about the money?"

"..there are legends that higher ranked people can live off of it, but you'll imagine how rare that can be, the fact is, everyone wanted in on the money but now, there are much more things and they all depend how high you are on the hierarchy ladder."
